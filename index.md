Data Analysis with Excel. In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze customer data from an iFood job interview case study given by the Brazilian equivalent of DoorDash, iFood. The main focus is:
- Understand the data.
- Find business opportunities & insights.
- Propose any data-driven action to optimize the results of the campaigns & generate value for the company.
