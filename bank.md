# The Finance Project - World Bank Group International Development Association's Projects and Programs in Pakistan


In the summer of 1981 my family packed up our household in rural Idaho and flew around the world to a new home and adventure in Islamabad, Pakistan. My father's new role in USAID/Pakistan's Office of Acriculture and Rural Development would keep us there for the next six years. I saw, first hand, the benefits of many World Bank projects. Tarbela Dam, the worlds largest earth-filled dam, was one of them that I saw on a school field trip. The World Bank has funded a few projects to expand the hydroelectric production. (Sorry for my poor photography skills.)

Some World Bank projects - like the On-Farm Water Management Program - also had support and bilateral funding from USAID. While the World Bank and USAID have distinct roles, they often collaborate and coordinate their efforts to maximize the impact of their development projects. These are a few photos of countryside and irrigation rehab activities taken by my father in 1983.
